# Gemini CLI Interaction Summary

**Objective:** Understand and document the existing `meong-cli` TypeScript project.

**User Request:** The user asked for help understanding their TypeScript-based CLI project, which acts as a client for a self-hosted Ollama+smollm model. The goal was to create a documentation file explaining how the repository works.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Code Analysis:** I read and analyzed all the TypeScript source files in the `src/` directory (`api.ts`, `cli.ts`, `config.ts`, `history.ts`, `index.ts`, `types.ts`) to understand the project's structure and logic.
2.  **Directory Creation:** I created a `docs/` directory to store the new documentation.
3.  **Documentation Generation:** I authored a detailed `docs/doc.md` file that explains:
    *   The overall project structure.
    *   The role of each core component (`api.ts`, `cli.ts`, `config.ts`, etc.).
    *   The end-to-end workflow of the application, from user input to API interaction and history management.
